# WUT Intro Artificiall Inteligence Course

This is a repository for projects that I created while attending a artificiall inteligence introduction at Warsaw University of technology as well as some additional projects that i wanted to do for the sake of my own understanding

## Tasks

1. Simple gradient descent and visualization
2. Evolutionary algorithms
3. Minimax with alpha-beta pruning in tic-tac-toe
4. Logistic regression on cancer patients dataset
5. Wine quality MLP (no tensorflow/torch) in pairs
6. Q-Learning for the cliff-walking exercise
7. Bayesian network using bnlearn for crime dataset

- The next ones are after the course, on my own

8. MLP using pure maths for mnist dataset, pygame ui to draw digits and classify them
9. Simple SVM
